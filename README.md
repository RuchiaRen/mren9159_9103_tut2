# Quiz 8 
## Part 1

- One imaging technology that profoundly impacted me is the dynamic maple leaf wallpaper on Android phones from ten years ago. When the user's finger touches the screen, the maple leaves would float, and the water would ripple. The work selected by our group is Monet's Sunset. I want to incorporate user interaction on the sea's surface to create ripples and simulate the waves with this technology. When smartphones became popular, this wallpaper made me appreciate the charm of technology, leaving a remarkable memory for many people. I want to evoke nostalgic feelings and create captivating interactive effects with it.

## Part 2
- To create the illusion of water, I can use a sine wave to produce a gentle, continuous oscillation and optimize the code according to this coding tutorial. For example, **y = sin(x)** creates a pleasing wobbly line. I adjust the phase using time: **y = sin(x - time)** to add animation. This results in a delightful animated wave that moves from left to right. I'll implement features like mouse-click interactions to enhance interactivity, enabling users to interact with the water.
